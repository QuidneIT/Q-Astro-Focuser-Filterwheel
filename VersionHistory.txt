ASCOM Management driver for Q-Astro FocusFilter
To be used with Q-Astro FocusFilter v1

Description:	Q-Astro (QA) Controller drivers is part of a LocalServer ASCOM Solution
		which uses an Arduino UNO board to control FilterWheel motor, Focuser motor
                & Power Relays through a single communication channel (USB Cable)

Implements:	ASCOM QA Focus & Filterwheel version: 2.0.0
